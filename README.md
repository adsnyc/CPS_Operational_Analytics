##  Overview
This project analyzes operational inefficiencies at **Central Parking Services (CPS)** — a leading Indian parking infrastructure company — using data-driven decision-making techniques.  
The objective was to transition CPS’s operations from reactive management to predictive, analytics-driven processes through **forecasting, segmentation, and simulation modeling**.

The analysis leveraged 3+ years of real transactional data from CPS’s **Howards End Mall (Mumbai)** location to identify inefficiencies in workforce planning, static pricing, and congestion management.
